INTERVIEW WITH A HOUSE

1. What about you is heroic?
2. What about you is social? What do you like about people?
3. Of what benefit could you be to the current group?
4. Why would you choose to join the current group?
5. Invent an adventure/plot that your character would actively undertake (as opposed to just tagging along)?

HEROIC THINGS
objects
design objects
 a house
 a safe
 an airstream trailer
 
chair
a chair can decide things
it can alter one's mood
it says things about a place, a person

a device
a device is a tool
it is a blank canvas
but it is also a product
of a massive corporation
it is watching


heists
heists are cool
there is a thrill
in taking on great risk
for a minorly great reward
subverting the rules
for gain
the rules are just rules



can a chair be heroic?
can a chair have a secret life?
can a chair be sexy?
