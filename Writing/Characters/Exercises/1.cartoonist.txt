INTERVIEW WITH CARTOONIST

**What about you is heroic?**

I create worlds that I would like to live in. Or rather, I sample from the world, both good and bad elements, and compose them in "fishbowl worlds," where I can see different situations play out. I'm not sure if that is heroism or cowardice. 

**What about you is social? What do you like about other people?**

I'm not terribly social. I can count my good friends on one hand, I think. I see them maybe once a year. They mostly live in other cities. I'm afraid I've lost touch with most of them.

What do I like about other people? They seem so competent. I live in fear of having to talk to people. I think I'm broken in some way. But I admire the way people can just say what they think. That they can have cogent thoughts spur of the moment, without having to make an outline, and test out the structure (of those thoughts). I like how they can just choose a job or at least live with a job they didn't choose, and somehow keep on doing it with a smile on their face. I've never been able to hold down a job in my life.

**Of what benefit could you be to the current group?**

I don't have a great answer for you. I'm an antihero-type. I am fit enough, but not so fit that I can wow you by removing my shirt. I'm not the handsome leading man. I'm handsome enough, mostly due to covering my face with affectations like this beard and these glasses. I used to shave my head but I look like a space alien when bald, so I've grown it out a bit. These are all stylistic affectations that I think could play well in the drawn page.

I have a superpower, I think. An ability to draw. In the drawn page, I can remake reality. Which seems like an odd thing. I'm bad at deciding things, so I'm bad at wielding my powers. But I think that if I'm paired with the right set of people I can make a difference.

**Why would you choose to join the current group?**

I'm tired of being alone, frankly. I like the idea of having family, being part of something.

**Invent an adventure/plot that your character would actively undertake, as opposed to just tagging along?**

I've drawn something or somebody. It's now out of control. I have to enter the drawn page myself to resolve the situation.

I'm searching for the magic hour. When inspiration strikes. It seems to happen when I do ____. So when ___ happens but shit hits the fan, I actively pursue the thing because I need the magic to happen.
