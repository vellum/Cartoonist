/**
 * `UIGestureRecognizer` subclass to enable one-finger-zoom gestures.
 *
 * `BDDROneFingerZoomGestureRecognizer` is a concrete subclass of `UIGestureRecognizer` that looks for long-press gestures
 * followed by a move with one finger to calculate a scale factor. When the user moves the finger towards the bottom screen edge,
 * the conventional meaning is zoom-out; when the user moves the finger towards the top screen edge, the conventional meaning is zoom-in.
 *
 * One-finger-zoom gestures are continuous. The gesture begins (`UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan`) when one finger taps the specified
 * amount of times (`numberOfTapsRequired`), has been pressed for the specified period (`minimumPressDuration`) while not moving beyond the
 * allowable range of movement (`allowableMovement`), and then moves. The gesture changes (`UIGestureRecognizerStateChanged`) whenever the finger
 * moves, and it ends (`UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded`) when the finger is lifted.
